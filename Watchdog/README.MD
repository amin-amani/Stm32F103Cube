## Letâ€™s take an example, if i want to set the Timeout of 20 ms.

I decided to choose the Prescalar as 8. So PR = 1

If we substitute these values in the above formula, we will get the RL = 79.

So we need to substitute counter value = 79 in our setup.

If the RL value goes higher than 4095, then you need to increase the prescalar.
